# About Us

Hello there! Welcome to Event Dex.

We are a small team of passionate Pokémon Go players who wanted to create a simple, easy-to-use app to help the community. We noticed that keeping track of all the different events in Pokémon Go could be a challenge, and we believed there had to be a better way to stay updated.

That's why we built Event Dex. Our goal is to make it effortless for you to find out about upcoming raids, Community Days, and other in-game events so you never miss out on the action. We're dedicated to providing a clear, reliable, and up-to-date resource for all trainers.

Thank you for using Event Dex and for being a part of this amazing community.
